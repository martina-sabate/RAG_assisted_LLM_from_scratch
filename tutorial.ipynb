    "# Step 2: Pre-processing the document\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you will need:\n",
    "1. PDF Document (skin cancer detection paper in my case)\n",
    "2. Embedding model (I am using Sentence-Bert)\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the Readme file, the aim of this tutorial is to build a RAG-assisted LLM that can retrieve information from research papers, helping students and researchers get a quicker understanding of the paper. This example will refer to a pdf titled *Real and simulated multispectral imaging of a palimpsest*. This paper is not yet publicly available since I am currently in the process of publishing, but feel free to use any paper you would like to retrieve information from. The same steps will apply to any paper / book. All you need to do is download it in pdf format and add your file path to the variable 'path'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pre-process the PDF document, we will use an embedding model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ Now, what does “embedding” mean in AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are trying to get our AI model to understand a paper (complex text data). The problem is, our model can only understand numbers. That is where embeddings come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An embedding is a way of representing complex data (like words or images) as a list of numbers — called a vector — in such a way that the relationships between items are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let’s dive into that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each item (a word, an image, a sentence) as a point in space - a location on a map. The closer two points are, the more related their meanings are.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The word “cat” will be close to “dog”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The word “car” will be far away from “banana”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s because in real life, cats and dogs are similar (both animals, pets), while a car and a banana are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So embeddings help us map meaning into a mathematical space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧐 What is an embedding model?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding model is an AI model that has learned how to take something complex — like a sentence — and turn it into a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different embedding models specialize in different kinds of data. The table below shows some examples of open-source embedding models for different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type      | Embedding model examples               | What do they capture?                            |\n",
    "|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Words          | Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText              | Word meanings, analogies, syntactic similarity   |\n",
    "| Sentences/Text | Sentence-BERT (SBERT), Instructor, E5  | Semantic similarity between sentences/documents  |\n",
    "| Images         | DINO, OpenCLIP                         | Visual concepts, cross-modal (image-text) meaning|\n",
    "| Audio          | Wav2Vec 2.0, Whisper                   | Speech content, audio features                   |\n",
    "| Code           | CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT                | Code syntax and semantics                        |\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are looking to read PDF documents, therefore, we need a model that embeds data based on semantic similarity. I have chosen Sentence-BERT, but it is interchangable for any sentence / text embedding model. Once you have build your own RAG-assisted LLM, you can experiment with different models and decide what works best for you\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that embedding models do not exactly embed words or sentences, they embed tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❓ What is a token?\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is a smallest unit of input that a language model (like GPT or BERT) understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most modern NLP systems, tokens are not exactly words — they can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A whole word (hello)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subword (un, believ, able)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A punctuation mark (!, .)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even just a few characters (Th, is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a token as a \"chunk\" of text — a building block the model processes one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Sentence: \"This is amazing!\" might be tokenized as:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ['This', ' is', ' amazing', '!']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "> Note that, on average in English text, 1 token is equal to 4 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now that we know how the data pre_processing will work, let's get started. \r\n",
    "\r\n"

    "For this tutorial, I use the [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) model from the `sentence-transformers` library. This lightweight model offers a strong balance between speed and performance. Trained on a diverse mix of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and paraphrase datasets, it is particularly effective for general-purpose **semantic similarity** tasks and is well-suited for applications with resource constraints. In my own experiments with the paper at hand, it showed the best balance between computational cost and accurate results.\n",

    "However, the **optimal embedding model may vary** depending on the domain of your content. For example, if you're working with complex scientific papers, you may want to experiment with [`specter2_base`](https://huggingface.co/allenai/specter2_base), developed by **Allen AI**. **SPECTER2** is trained specifically on citation networks and scientific corpora, making it highly effective for embedding scholarly documents in a way that captures **citation-based semantic relationships**. It is particularly useful for literature recommendation and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another robust alternative is [`all-mpnet-base-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2), also from `sentence-transformers`. It is considered one of the **highest-performing models** for general sentence embeddings across various benchmarks like **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)** and clustering tasks. It provides better performance than `MiniLM` in many contexts but comes with a **higher computational cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, while `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is a great starting point for many use cases, I encourage you to **test different models** depending on the specificity of your domain and performance needs. Embedding model choice can significantly affect downstream task accuracy, especially in specialized fields such as **law**, **medicine**, or **scientific research**.\n"

    "# Step 3: Similarity Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have embedded the text segments, we can move on to performing **semantic similarity search**. This allows us to retrieve the most relevant information from the paper based on a user query — a key step in building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we're doing:\n",
    "We want to search for a query (e.g. *\"How many times is UCL equipment mentioned in the paper?\"*) and retrieve the most relevant segments of text. These segments can then be passed to an LLM to generate an accurate and grounded response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps involved:\n",
    "1. **Define the query string**  \n",
    "2. **Convert the query string into an embedding**, using the same model used to embed the text segments\n",
    "3. **Compute similarity** between the query embedding and each text chunk embedding using a similarity function like the **dot product** or **cosine similarity** function\n",
    "4. **Sort the results** by similarity score in descending order to identify the most relevant segments  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**  \n",
    "> When using dot product, make sure that:\n",
    "> - The query and document embeddings have the same vector shape\n",
    "> - Both are converted to the same data type (e.g., float32 tensors)\n",
    "\n",
    "This similarity step is crucial in ensuring the LLM receives contextually relevant information, improving the accuracy of the final response.\n"
