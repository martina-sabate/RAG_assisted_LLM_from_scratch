    "#### What you will need:\n",
    "1. PDF Document (skin cancer detection paper in my case)\n",
    "2. Embedding model (I am using Sentence-Bert)\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the Readme file, the aim of this tutorial is to build a RAG-assisted LLM that can retrieve information from research papers, helping students and researchers get a quicker understanding of the paper. I will be using the paper *Skin Cancer Detection using ML Techniques* <sup>1</sup> for this example.  Feel free to use any paper you would like to retrieve information from, the same steps will apply to any paper / book. All you need to do is download it in pdf format and add your file path to the variable 'path'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To pre-process the PDF document, we will use an embedding model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ Now, what does “embedding” mean in AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are trying to get our AI model to understand a paper (complex text data). The problem is, our model can only understand numbers. That is where embeddings come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An embedding is a way of representing complex data (like words or images) as a list of numbers — called a vector — in such a way that the relationships between items are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let’s dive into that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of each item (a word, an image, a sentence) as a point in space - a location on a map. The closer two points are, the more related their meanings are.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The word “cat” will be close to “dog”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The word “car” will be far away from “banana”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s because in real life, cats and dogs are similar (both animals, pets), while a car and a banana are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So embeddings help us map meaning into a mathematical space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧐 What is an embedding model?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding model is an AI model that has learned how to take something complex — like a sentence — and turn it into a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different embedding models specialize in different kinds of data. The table below shows some examples of open-source embedding models for different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type         | Embedding model examples    | What do they capture? |\r\n",
    "|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------\n",
    "| Words | Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText | Word meanings, analogies, syntactic similarity |\n",
    "| Sentences / Text | Sentence-BERT (SBERT), Instructor, E5 | Semantic similarity between sentences/documents |\n",
    "| Images              |  DINO, OpenCLIP   | Visual concepts, cross-modal (image-text) meaning   |\n",
    "| Audio               |  Wav2Vec 2.0, Whisper  | Speech content, audio features   |\n",
    "| Code | CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT | Code syntax and semantics |  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are looking to read PDF documents, therefore, we need a model that embeds data based on semantic similarity. I have chosen Sentence-BERT, but it is interchangable for any sentence / text embedding model. Once you have build your own RAG-assisted LLM, you can experiment with different models and decide what works best for you\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that embedding models do not exactly embed words or sentences, they embed tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❓ What is a token?\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is a smallest unit of input that a language model (like GPT or BERT) understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most modern NLP systems, tokens are not exactly words — they can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A whole word (hello)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subword (un, believ, able)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A punctuation mark (!, .)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even just a few characters (Th, is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a token as a \"chunk\" of text — a building block the model processes one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Sentence: \"This is amazing!\" might be tokenized as:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ['This', ' is', ' amazing', '!']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "> Note that, on average in English text, 1 token is equal to 4 characters.\n",

      "{'page_number': 1, 'text': 'Various studies have proposed using smartphone cameras for MSI, mainly motivated by the biomedical optics community, with the aim of monitoring haemodynamics by detecting the different spectral characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in blood. Some of these require modifications or additions to the smartphone [7–10] but a new approach by He and Wang [11,12] was able to derive simulated multispectral images from an unmodified smartphone camera. Here, we adapt the method of He and Wang and apply it to generating simulated multispectral images from digitised photographs of a palimpsest. The photographs were acquired using standard digitisation protocols so the method described here could be applied to any digitised images. The technique requires a colourchecker chart which is imaged using a multispectral imaging system and with standard photography. These images are processed to provide a matrix which can convert a red-green-blue (RGB) colour photograph to a simulated multi-wavelength MSI dataset. Multispectral images have a number of advantages over RGB images, and the method described here can only emulate some of these advantages. Cameras used for RGB and MSI photography are both based on silicon sensors so have the same intrinsic spectral range from about 300 nm in the ultraviolet to 1100 nm in the near infrared. However, a commercial RGB camera has its effective spectral range reduced to about 400-800 nm to match that of the eye, by using standard glass lenses that absorb in the ultraviolet and an infrared blocking filter that excludes longer wavelengths. An MSI system maintains sensitivity further into the ultraviolet and infrared than a commercial RGB camera by using UV-transparent glass lenses and omitting the infrared blocking filter. However, more importantly, the wavelength-selective filters supplied with MSI systems are optimised for enhancing sensitivity to fluorescence. A post-processing technique such as the one proposed here could in principle offer a slightly increased spectral range by enhancing the limited sensitivity at the longest and shortest wavelengths, but it cannot offer significant sensitivity to fluorescence without changes to hardware. Here, therefore we distinguish between four methods: (i) full multispectral imaging of a palimpsest; (ii) reduced MSI imaging (excluding fluorescence); (iii) unprocessed RGB photographs; and (iv) simulated MSI images obtained by processing the RGB images with knowledge gained from the colourchecker chart. This method has the potential to offer simulated MSI for institutions that do not have access to MSI systems, and perhaps more importantly, to the many millions of objects that have already been digitised using standard photographic processes. The software was written in Matlab R2023b (The Mathworks USA) and is available ***. 2. Methods 2.1 Palimpsest The manuscript is held by UCL Special Collections (MS LAT/15). It is an early 14th Century manuscript volume and was bequeathed to UCL by John Graves (1806-1870), mathematician and Professor of Jurisprudence. It contains a number of different works on mathematics, astronomy and astrology, some by Johannes de Sacro Bosco (c. 1195 – c. 1256) which were some of the first Western European texts to use Arabic numerals [13]. They are written in various hands but bound in a single volume of 33 leaves cut to 217 x 162 mm [14]. Some of the leaves are palimpsests with the undertext visible in the margin of the overtext (Figure 1). Prior to this study, the manuscript was described in the catalogue record [15] as “a'}\n"

The photographs are 2696 x 3512 pixels and were acquired with a Canon EOS 6D camera with a 50 mm lens at f/8 and ISO100 using a copystand with white tungsten lighting. All images were acquired and colour corrected following UCL Special Collections’ digitisation protocols. Figure 1: MS LAT/15, showing the recto (left) and verso (right) of folio 13. The horizontal overtext is dominant, but the partially erased undertext can be seen running vertically in the margins.

It is based around a PhaseOne XF camera (PhaseOne, Denmark) with an IQ3 digital back which generates 11608 × 8708 pixel, monochrome, 16 bit images, and a 120 mm apochromatic lens. Two LED lighting panels (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA) provide illumination at 16 discrete wavelengths from 365 nm to 940 nm and a filter wheel, equipped with longpass filters (Thorlabs, USA), can exclude the illuminating light to enhance sensitivity to fluorescence. The system is controlled using Spectral XV v2.1.0.0 (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA) and Capture One v12.0.2.13 (PhaseOne, Denmark) software.',\n",

      "   Text: Various studies have proposed using smartphone cameras for MSI, mainly motivated by the biomedical optics community, with the aim of monitoring haemodynamics by detecting the different spectral characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in blood. Some of these require modifications or additions to the smartphone [7–10] but a new approach by He and Wang [11,12] was able to derive simulated multispectral images from an unmodified smartphone camera. Here, we adapt the method of He and Wang and apply it to generating simulated multispectral images from digitised photographs of a palimpsest. The photographs were acquired using standard digitisation protocols so the method described here could be applied to any digitised images. The technique requires a colourchecker chart which is imaged using a multispectral imaging system and with standard photography. These images are processed to provide a matrix which can convert a red-green-blue (RGB) colour photograph to a simulated multi-wavelength MSI dataset. Multispectral images have a number of advantages over RGB images, and the method described here can only emulate some of these advantages. Cameras used for RGB and MSI photography are both based on silicon sensors so have the same intrinsic spectral range from about 300 nm in the ultraviolet to 1100 nm in the near infrared. However, a commercial RGB camera has its effective spectral range reduced to about 400-800 nm to match that of the eye, by using standard glass lenses that absorb in the ultraviolet and an infrared blocking filter that excludes longer wavelengths. An MSI system maintains sensitivity further into the ultraviolet and infrared than a commercial RGB camera by using UV-transparent glass lenses and omitting the infrared blocking filter. However, more importantly, the wavelength-selective filters supplied with MSI systems are optimised for enhancing sensitivity to fluorescence. A post-processing technique such as the one proposed here could in principle offer a slightly increased spectral range by enhancing the limited sensitivity at the longest and shortest wavelengths, but it cannot offer significant sensitivity to fluorescence without changes to hardware. Here, therefore we distinguish between four methods: (i) full multispectral imaging of a palimpsest; (ii) reduced MSI imaging (excluding fluorescence); (iii) unprocessed RGB photographs; and (iv) simulated MSI images obtained by processing the RGB images with knowledge gained from the colourchecker chart. This method has the potential to offer simulated MSI for institutions that do not have access to MSI systems, and perhaps more importantly, to the many millions of objects that have already been digitised using standard photographic processes. The software was written in Matlab R2023b (The Mathworks USA) and is available ***.\n",

It is an early 14th Century manuscript volume and was bequeathed to UCL by John Graves (1806-1870), mathematician and Professor of Jurisprudence. It contains a number of different works on mathematics, astronomy and astrology, some by Johannes de Sacro Bosco (c. 1195 – c. 1256) which were some of the first Western European texts to use Arabic numerals [13]. They are written in various hands but bound in a single volume of 33 leaves cut to 217 x 162 mm [14]. Some of the leaves are palimpsests with the undertext visible in the margin of the overtext (Figure 1). Prior to this study, the manuscript was described in the catalogue record [15] as “a\n",

      "   Text: Various studies have proposed using smartphone cameras for MSI, mainly motivated by the biomedical optics community, with the aim of monitoring haemodynamics by detecting the different spectral characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in blood. Some of these require modifications or additions to the smartphone [7–10] but a new approach by He and Wang [11,12] was able to derive simulated multispectral images from an unmodified smartphone camera. Here, we adapt the method of He and Wang and apply it to generating simulated multispectral images from digitised photographs of a palimpsest. The photographs were acquired using standard digitisation protocols so the method described here could be applied to any digitised images. The technique requires a colourchecker chart which is imaged using a multispectral imaging system and with standard photography. These images are processed to provide a matrix which can convert a red-green-blue (RGB) colour photograph to a simulated multi-wavelength MSI dataset. Multispectral images have a number of advantages over RGB images, and the method described here can only emulate some of these advantages. Cameras used for RGB and MSI photography are both based on silicon sensors so have the same intrinsic spectral range from about 300 nm in the ultraviolet to 1100 nm in the near infrared. However, a commercial RGB camera has its effective spectral range reduced to about 400-800 nm to match that of the eye, by using standard glass lenses that absorb in the ultraviolet and an infrared blocking filter that excludes longer wavelengths. An MSI system maintains sensitivity further into the ultraviolet and infrared than a commercial RGB camera by using UV-transparent glass lenses and omitting the infrared blocking filter. However, more importantly, the wavelength-selective filters supplied with MSI systems are optimised for enhancing sensitivity to fluorescence. A post-processing technique such as the one proposed here could in principle offer a slightly increased spectral range by enhancing the limited sensitivity at the longest and shortest wavelengths, but it cannot offer significant sensitivity to fluorescence without changes to hardware. Here, therefore we distinguish between four methods: (i) full multispectral imaging of a palimpsest; (ii) reduced MSI imaging (excluding fluorescence); (iii) unprocessed RGB photographs; and (iv) simulated MSI images obtained by processing the RGB images with knowledge gained from the colourchecker chart. This method has the potential to offer simulated MSI for institutions that do not have access to MSI systems, and perhaps more importantly, to the many millions of objects that have already been digitised using standard photographic processes. The software was written in Matlab R2023b (The Mathworks USA) and is available ***.\n",

The photographs are 2696 x 3512 pixels and were acquired with a Canon EOS 6D camera with a 50 mm lens at f/8 and ISO100 using a copystand with white tungsten lighting. All images were acquired and colour corrected following UCL Special Collections’ digitisation protocols. Figure 1: MS LAT/15, showing the recto (left) and verso (right) of folio 13. The horizontal overtext is dominant, but the partially erased undertext can be seen running vertically in the margins. Red rubrication is clearly visible, as are some damage and repairs.2.3 Multispectral imaging The UCL Multispectral Imaging system was supplied by R B Toth Associates (USA). It is based around a PhaseOne XF camera (PhaseOne, Denmark) with an IQ3 digital back which generates 11608 × 8708 pixel, monochrome, 16 bit images, and a 120 mm apochromatic lens. Two LED lighting panels (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA) provide illumination at 16 discrete wavelengths from 365 nm to 940 nm and a filter wheel, equipped with longpass filters (Thorlabs, USA), can exclude the illuminating light to enhance sensitivity to fluorescence. The system is controlled using Spectral XV v2.1.0.0 (Equipoise Imaging LLC, USA) and Capture One v12.0.2.13 (PhaseOne, Denmark) software.\n",
