# Your Study Assistant, built from scratch
Build Your Own RAG-Assisted Large Language Model (LLM) ‚Äì Step-by-Step Guide (beginner friendly)

üìñ **A Practical AI Tutorial for anyone getting started with AI and LLMs**

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch. RAG is a technique used to ground a Large Language Model (LLM) on documents / literature of your choice. We will code this from scratch using open-source tools. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to:

- Implement RAG architecture to enhance LLMs with external knowledge.
- Connect LLMs (like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT) with document search capabilities.
- Deploy a functional AI model with Streamlit for easy interaction.

üí° **The Use Case:**

AI Assistant for Research Papers. To make this tutorial practical, we apply the RAG model to help students and researchers quickly understand complex research papers. Upload any paper you need to read and retrieve information from it in seconds.

üìå **Tech Stack & Concepts You'll Learn**

### üß† Introduction: What is a RAG Pipeline and Why Build One from Scratch?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding and generating human-like text. However, they have an inherent limitation: they don‚Äôt know what they haven‚Äôt been trained on. Once trained, their knowledge is fixed, making them prone to hallucinations and outdated responses, especially when dealing with niche, dynamic, or domain-specific information.

This is where RAG ‚Äî Retrieval-Augmented Generation ‚Äî comes in.

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI, allowing LLMs to access and reason over external documents at runtime. Rather than relying purely on the model‚Äôs pre-trained parameters, RAG lets you retrieve relevant snippets of information from a corpus and inject them into the model‚Äôs prompt to improve factual accuracy and contextual relevance.

In this tutorial, we walk through building a RAG pipeline from scratch using a PDF of a scientific paper as the source of knowledge. You will learn how to extract meaningful text, store it in a searchable format, and dynamically retrieve the top-k relevant chunks based on user queries. This will enhance the response generation of an open-source LLM.

### üõ†Ô∏è Why Learn to Build a RAG Pipeline from Scratch?
Building a RAG pipeline yourself ‚Äî rather than relying on out-of-the-box tools ‚Äî is a powerful learning experience for several reasons:

**1. Demystify How AI Systems Work**


RAG represents a practical, modular architecture that mimics how real-world AI applications function: a hybrid of classical NLP techniques (like search and ranking) with generative deep learning models. Learning to construct it step-by-step exposes you to the anatomy of a modern AI system.

You‚Äôll learn:

- How to parse and chunk raw data (like PDFs)

- How to represent text using vector embeddings

- How to use vector databases for fast similarity search

- How to design a system that feeds context into an LLM dynamically

**2. Gain Full Control**


Prebuilt frameworks are great for prototyping, but building RAG from scratch gives you:

- Full control over every step of the pipeline (e.g., chunking strategy, embedding models, retrieval logic)

- The ability to debug, customize, and optimize for specific use cases

- A deeper understanding of failure points (e.g., irrelevant chunks, semantic drift)

**3. Enhance Model Accuracy with Domain-Specific Knowledge**


By injecting context from external sources, RAG lets you turn general-purpose LLMs into domain-aware assistants. Whether you're working with scientific research, legal documents, financial reports, or customer support tickets, RAG enables the model to reason over your own data with precision.


In this tutorial, we demonstrate this with a scientific PDF ‚Äî allowing the LLM to answer user questions grounded in the original paper, even if that paper was never part of the model‚Äôs training data.

4. Learn the Foundations for More Advanced Applications
Understanding how to build a RAG pipeline is a stepping stone toward more advanced AI systems:

Conversational Agents with Memory: Extend RAG to support chat history and session-aware retrieval.

Multi-modal Pipelines: Add image, audio, or structured data retrieval.

Enterprise Knowledge Management: Apply RAG to company documents, wikis, and databases.

### üöÄ What You‚Äôll Build in This Tutorial
In this hands-on tutorial, you‚Äôll build a minimal but complete RAG pipeline that:

Parses a PDF scientific paper and extracts its text.

Chunks the text into semantically meaningful units.

Embeds the chunks using a pre-trained open-source embedding model.

Accepts a user query, and retrieves the top 5 most relevant chunks.

Augments the prompt of a local open-source LLM with the retrieved chunks.

Generates a grounded answer, citing the source material.

### üéØ Who Is This For?
This tutorial is for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts who:

1. Want to deeply understand how retrieval-based LLM systems work

2. Need to build AI applications grounded in trusted external data

3. Enjoy learning by building, testing, and experimenting

Whether you're building internal tools, research assistants, or customer-facing AI products, understanding how RAG pipelines work under the hood will give you a major advantage.
